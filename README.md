.dotfiles
=========

To initialize the dotfiles, run the `init-dotfiles` script.
To remove the dotfiles, run the `reset-dotfiles` script.

You can add a local `.bash_profile` by adding a `.bash_profile.local` to your
home directory.

To get preferred apps, run the `downloads` script. After that's done, run
the `.brewfile`.
