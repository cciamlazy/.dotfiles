# .dotfiles

This is for my personal use. Feel free to use any of these scripts, but run them
at your own discretion. I am not responsible for any effects of these scripts
on your machine.

To initialize the dotfiles, run the `init-dotfiles` script.

You can add a local `.bash_profile` by adding a `.bash_profile.local` to your
home directory.
